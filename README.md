The CUPS Local Services provide the general printing commands and a local, per-
user spooler that handles conversion of print files and communications with IPP
printers.  This project is part of OpenPrinting's CUPS 3.0 development, which
will provide a 100% driverless printing system for Unix®-like operating systems.
